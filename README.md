# AI_generated_review_detection

The "Shared Task on Detecting AI-generated Product Reviews in Dravidian Languages" aimed at addressing the growing concern of AI-generated product reviews, specifically in Malayalam and Tamil.

As AI tools become more advanced, the ability to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated content has become increasingly crucial, especially in the domain of online reviews where authenticity is essential for consumer decision-making. 

In our approach, we utilized ALBERT, IndicBERT, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models to classify the reviews. The results of our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in detecting AI-generated content.
